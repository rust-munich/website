Rust Munich is a community of Rustaceans in Munich. We host talks and casual meetups.
We welcome speakers of all levels and backgrounds — reach out if you want to present!

## Code of Conduct

Rust Munich uses the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org). Please read it before attending.

Our primary goal is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
If you experience or witness a violation, contact the organizers in person at events or by email.

## The Team

### Current Organizers

**Ludwig** is our networking guru — he knows every Rustacean by name before they even know they are a Rustacean. Following a wide range of topics and interests: from embedded over security to backend, Ludwig somehow manages to keep track of what everyone in the community is working on and loves connecting people with shared interests.

**Sven** is the kind of person who reads compiler error messages for fun and actually understands them. When he's not diving deep into the latest Rust RFC, he's probably explaining why that "simple" optimization you suggested isn't actually that simple (but in the nicest way possible).

**Jonas** brings that perfect mix of pragmatism and curiosity that keeps our meetups grounded yet innovative. He has this uncanny ability to ask exactly the right question that makes everyone go "oh wait, what about...?" and suddenly the whole discussion gets ten times more interesting.

### Alumni

**Bernhard** was instrumental in getting Rust Munich off the ground. His passion for building inclusive tech communities and knack for organizing events that people actually want to attend helped shape what we are today. Though he's moved on to new adventures, his influence on our community spirit lives on.
