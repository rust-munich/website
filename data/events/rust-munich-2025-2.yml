  We are excited to continue the new format of hacking one evening all together that we started in December 2024.

  This time we'll explore solutions from the previous "1 billion row challenge" - what worked and what didn't.

  Participants work individually or in small groups for approximately 2 hours, with initial instructional slides and a dedicated Discord channel for code sharing and assistance.

  **What to bring:**
  - Laptop with display
  - Rust compiler (stable) or Docker with rustup
  - Your favorite IDE/editor (zed.dev, VSCode, or RustRover)
  - GitHub and Discord accounts

  Drinks and snacks provided!

  Challenge repo: https://github.com/rust-munich/hack-evening-2025-2

  **How to get there:**
  - U6 to Garching-Forschungszentrum (~10 min walk)
  - Free parking available on-site
