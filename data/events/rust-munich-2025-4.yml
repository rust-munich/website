  Hands-on mini-hackathon where up to 24 participants work together on an Advent of Code challenge.

  Similar to university times when you had to solve small problems in the computer lab within an hour - but with Rust programming applied to workplace-relevant skills.

  Participants receive an initial presentation outlining the project and required dependencies, then have approximately 2 hours to complete the task individually or in small groups.

  **What to bring:**
  - Laptop with display
  - Rust compiler (stable) or Docker with rustup
  - Your favorite IDE/editor
  - GitHub account
  - Discord account (optional)

  Drinks and snacks provided!
